--> Introduction
 Shell scripts are files in which we write a sequence of commands that we need to pe-
 rform. And the script file is executed using the shell utility.
 
 When opened, in a terminal, a prompt is available. It is usually in the following f-
 ormat:
 > username@hostname$
 Or:
 > root@hostname#
 Or simply as $ or #.
 $ represents regular users and # represents the administrative user root.
 
 A shell script is a text file that typically begins with a shebang, as follows:
 #!/bin/bash
 For any scripting language in a Linux environment, a script starts with a special l-
 ine called shebang. Shebang is a line for which #! is prefixed to the interpreter p-
 ath. /bin/bash is the interpreter command path for Bash.
 
 The script can be run with the filename as a command-line argument as follows:
 $ sh script.sh # Assuming script is in the current directory.
 Or:
 $ sh /home/path/script.sh # Using full path of script.sh.
 If a script is run as a command-line argument for sh, the shebang in the script is -
 of no use.
 
 In order to self execute a shell script, it requires executable permission.
 $ chmod a+x script.sh
 The script can be executed as:
 $ ./script.sh #./ represents the current directory
 Or:
 $ /home/path/script.sh # Full path of the script is used
 The shell program will read the first line and see that the shebang is  #!/bin/bash. 
 It will identify the /bin/bash and execute the script internally as:
 $ /bin/bash script.sh
 
 In Bash, each command or command sequence is delimited by using a semicolon or a new
 line. For example:
 $ cmd1 ; cmd2
 This is equivalent to:
 $ cmd1
 $ cmd2
 
 Finally, the # character is used to denote the beginning of unprocessed comments.  A
 comment section starts with # and proceeds up to the end of that line. 
 
 -->--> print in the terminal
  echo
  printf
 -->--> variables and environment variables
  Scripting languages usually do not require variable type declaration before its us-
  e. It can be assigned directly. In Bash, the value for every variable is string. If 
  we assign variables with quotes or without quotes, they are stored as string. There 
  are special variables used by the shell environment and the operating system envir-
  onment to store special values, which are called environment variables.
 
  A variable can be assigned as follows:
  var=value
  var is the name of a variable and value is the value to be assigned. If value  does 
  not contain any white space characters (like a space), it need not be enclosed in -
  quotes, else it must be enclosed in single or double quotes. Note that  var = value 
  and var=value are different. It is a common mistake to write var =value instead  of 
  var=value. The later is the assignment operation, whereas the former is an equality 
  operation.
  
  Printing the contents of a variable is done using by prefixing $ with the  variable 
  name as follows:
  var="value" #Assignment of value to variable var.
  echo $var
  Or:
  echo ${var}
  The output is as follows:
  value
  We can use variable values inside printf or echo in double quotes.
  #!/bin/bash
  #Filename :variables.sh
  fruit=apple
  count=5
  echo "We have $count ${fruit}(s)"
  The output is as follows:
  We have 5 apple(s)
  
  Finding length of string  length=${#var}
  $ var=12345678901234567890
  $ echo ${#var}
  20
  
  Identifying the current shell
  echo $SHELL
  echo $0

 -->--> Doing math calculations with the shell
  The Bash shell environment can perform basic arithmetic operations using the comma-
  nds let, (( )), and []. The two utilities expr and bc are also very helpful in per-
  forming advanced operations.
 
  A numeric value can be assigned as a regular variable assignment, which is stored -
  as string. However, we use methods to manipulate as numbers.
  
  #!/bin/bash
  no1=4;
  no2=5;
  let result=no1+no2
  echo $result
  let no1++
  let no1--
  let no+=6
  let no-=6
  
  The [] operator can be used similar to the let command as follows:
  result=$[ no1 + no2 ]
  Using $ prefix inside [] operators are legal, for example:
  result=$[ $no1 + 5 ]
  
  (( )) can also be used. $ prefixed with a variable name is used when the (( )) ope-
  rator is used, as follows:
  result=$(( no1 + 50 ))
  
  expr can also be used for basic operations:
  result=`expr 3 + 4`
  result=$(expr $no1 + 5)

--> file descriptors and redirection
 File descriptors are integers associated with an opened file or data stream. File d-
 escriptors 0, 1, and 2 are reserved as follows:
 0 C stdin (standard input)      /dev/stdin
 1 C stdout (standard output)    /dev/stdout
 2 C stderr (standard error)     /dev/stderr 
                                 /dev/null
 
 $ cmd 2>stderr.txt 1>stdout.txt
 
 It is also possible to redirect stderr and stdout to a single file by converting   -
 stderr to stdout using this preferred method:
 $ cmd 2>&1 output.txt
 or an alternate approach:
 $ cmd &> output.txt
 
 tee
 
 By using redirection, we can read data from a file as stdin as follows:
 $ cmd < file
 
 -->--> Custom file descriptors
  A file descriptor is an abstract indicator for accessing a file. Each file access -
  is associated with a special number called a file descriptor. 0, 1, and 2 are rese-
  rved descriptor numbers for stdin, stdout, and stderr. We can create our own custom 
  file descriptors using the exec command. 
  
  Create a file descriptor for reading a file, as follows:
  $ exec 3<input.txt # open for reading with descriptor number 3
  We could use it as follows:
  $ echo this is a test line > input.txt
  $ exec 3<input.txt
  Now you can use file descriptor 3 with commands. For example, cat <&3 as follows:
  $ cat <&3
  this is a test line
  
  Create a file descriptor for writing (truncate mode) as follows:
  $ exec 4>output.txt # open for writing
  For example:
  $ exec 4>output.txt
  $ echo newline >&4
  $ cat output.txt
  newline
  Create a file descriptor for writing (append mode) as follows:
  $ exec 5>>input.txt
  
  For example:
  $ exec 5>>input.txt
  $ echo appended line >&5
  $ cat input.txt
  newline
  appended line

 -->-->for 循环
  for循环一般格式为：
  for var in item1 item2 ... itemN
  do
      command1
      command2
      ...
      commandN
  done
  写成一行：
  for var in item1 item2 ... itemN; do command1; command2… done;
                                                                                     |
  当变量值在列表里，for循环即执行一次所有命令，使用变量名获取列表中的当前取值。命令可|
  为任何有效的shell命令和语句。in列表可以包含替换、字符串和文件名。 in列表是可选的， |
  如果不用它，for循环使用命令行的位置参数。

  for loop in 1 2 3 4 5
  do
      echo "The value is: $loop"
  done 
  
  输出结果：
  The value is: 1
  The value is: 2
  The value is: 3
  The value is: 4
  The value is: 5

  for str in 'This is a string'
  do
      echo $str
  done
  
  输出结果：
  This is a string




  
  
  
  
  
  
  

1 $表示普通用户 #表示超级用户
2 shell脚本以#！开始，例如#！/bin/bash。后面是bash的路径。
3 运行一个脚本
  $ sh script.sh         #运行当前目录下的script.sh脚本，也可以标出路径。
  $ chmod a+x scritp.sh  #赋予所有用户script.sh文件的可执行权限。
  $ ./script.sh          #./表示当前目录，shell程序读取脚本的首行，看是否为#!/bin/bash。
                         #他会识别/bin/bash，并在内部以 /bin/bash script.sh 命令执行该脚本。

  

Finding length of string
Get the length of a variable value as follows:
length=${#var}
For example:
$ var=12345678901234567890
$ echo ${#var}
20
length is the number of characters in the string.

Identifying the current shell
Display the currently used shell as follows:
echo $SHELL
Or, you can also use:
echo $0 
For example:
$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
$ echo $0
bash
