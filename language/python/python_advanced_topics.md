## What’s a Decorator?  

Decoration is a way to specify management or augmentation code for functions and classes. Decorators themselves take the form of callable objects (e.g., functions) that process other callable objects. In short, decorators provide a way to insert automatically run code at the end of function and class definition statements--at the end of a def for function decorators, and at the end of a class for class decorators.
