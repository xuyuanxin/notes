repr(object)

Return a string containing a printable representation of an object. For many types, -
this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the 
same value when passed to eval(), otherwise the representation is a string enclosed -
in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with add-
itional information often including the name and address of the object. A class can -
control what this function returns for its instances by defining a __repr__() method.


>>> print repr("Hello, world!")
'Hello, world!'
>>> print repr(10000L)

'Hello, world!'
>>> 10000L
10000L
>>> print "Hello, world!"
