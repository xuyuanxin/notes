class str(object='')
class str(object=b'', encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')
Return a str version of object. See str() for details.

str is the built-in string class. For general information about strings, see Text Sequence Type ¡ª str.

Actually, str is a type, just like int and long. repr, however, is simply a function.

>>> print str("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
>>> print str(10000L)
10000


>>> temp = 42
>>> print "The temperature is " + temp
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#61>", line 1, in ?
print "The temperature is " + temp
TypeError: cannot add type "int" to string
>>> print "The temperature is " + `temp` 
The temperature is 42
 
converted temp to the string "42" by using the backticks. 
In short, str, repr, and backticks are three ways of converting a Python value to a string.
The function str makes it look good, while repr (and the backticks) tries to make the resulting
string a legal Python expression.
