'''
Return the floating point value @number rounded to @ndigits digits after the  decimal 
point. If @ndigits is omitted, it defaults to zero. The result is a floating point n-
umber. Values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus  @ndigits; 
if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done away from 0 (so, for example,  -
round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0).
