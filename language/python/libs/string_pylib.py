def join(words[, sep]) # string.join(words[, sep])
  '''
  Concatenate a list or tuple of @words with intervening occurrences of @sep. The de-
  fault value for @sep is a single space character. It is always true that          -
  string.join(string.split(s, sep), sep) equals s.

  >>> print '+'.join(list('hello'))
  h+e+l+l+o

----> String Formatting
To the left of the %, you place a string (the format string); to the right of it, yo-
u place the value you want to format. You can use a single value such as a string  or 
a number, you can use a tuple of values (if you want to format more than one), or, d-
ictionary. The most common case is the tuple. If you use a list or some other sequen-
ce instead of a tuple, the sequence will be interpreted as a single value. Only     -
tuples and dictionaries will allow you to format more than one value.

>>> format = "Hello, %s. %s enough for ya?"
>>> values = ('world', 'Hot')
>>> print format % values
Hello, world. Hot enough for ya?

Note 
To actually include a percent sign in the format string, you must write %% so  Python 
doesn¡¯t mistake it for the beginning of a conversion specifier.


>>> format = "Pi with three decimals: %.3f"
>>> from math import pi
>>> print format % pi
Pi with three decimals: 3.142
