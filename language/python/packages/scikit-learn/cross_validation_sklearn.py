def train_test_split(*arrays, **options): # sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split
    """Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets
    Quick utility that wraps input validation and
    ``next(iter(ShuffleSplit(n_samples)))`` and application to input
    data into a single call for splitting (and optionally subsampling)
    data in a oneliner.
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    *arrays : sequence of indexables with same length / shape[0]
        allowed inputs are lists, numpy arrays, scipy-sparse
        matrices or pandas dataframes.
        .. versionadded:: 0.16
            preserves input type instead of always casting to numpy array.
    test_size : float, int, or None (default is None)
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the test split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of test samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the train size.
        If train size is also None, test size is set to 0.25.
    train_size : float, int, or None (default is None)
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.
    random_state : int or RandomState
        Pseudo-random number generator state used for random sampling.
    stratify : array-like or None (default is None)
        If not None, data is split in a stratified fashion, using this as
        the labels array.
        .. versionadded:: 0.17
           *stratify* splitting
    Returns
    -------
    splitting : list, length = 2 * len(arrays),
        List containing train-test split of inputs.
        .. versionadded:: 0.16
            Output type is the same as the input type.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
    >>> X, y = np.arange(10).reshape((5, 2)), range(5)
    >>> X
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5],
           [6, 7],
           [8, 9]])
    >>> list(y)
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    ...     X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
    ...
    >>> X_train
    array([[4, 5],
           [0, 1],
           [6, 7]])
    >>> y_train
    [2, 0, 3]
    >>> X_test
    array([[2, 3],
           [8, 9]])
    >>> y_test
    [1, 4]
