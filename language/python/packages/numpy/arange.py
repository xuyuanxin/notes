numpy.arange

numpy.arange([start, ]stop, [step, ]dtype=None)
Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (in other words, the interval including start but excluding stop). For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in range function, but returns an ndarray rather than a list.

When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not be consistent. It is better to use linspace for these cases.

Parameters:	
start : number, optional
Start of interval. The interval includes this value. The default start value is 0.
stop : number
End of interval. The interval does not include this value, except in some cases where step is not an integer and floating point round-off affects the length of out.
step : number, optional
Spacing between values. For any output out, this is the distance between two adjacent values, out[i+1] - out[i]. The default step size is 1. If step is specified, start must also be given.
dtype : dtype
The type of the output array. If dtype is not given, infer the data type from the other input arguments.
Returns:	
arange : ndarray
Array of evenly spaced values.
For floating point arguments, the length of the result is ceil((stop - start)/step). Because of floating point overflow, this rule may result in the last element of out being greater than stop.
