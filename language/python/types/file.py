def close():
    ''' file.close()
    |with open("somefile.txt") as somefile:
    |    do_something(somefile)
    The with statement lets you open a file and assign it to a variable name (in this 
	case,somefile). You then write data to your file (and, perhaps, do other  things) 
	in the body of the statement, and the file is automatically closed when the end -
	of the statement is reached, even if that is caused by an exception.
	
	the data may be buffered (stored temporarily somewhere in memory), and not writt-
	en until you close the file. If you want to keep working with the file (and not -
	close it) but still want to make sure the file on disk is updated to reflect your 
	changes, call the file object¡¯s flush method.
	
	You should always close a file you have written to because Python may buffer (ke-
	ep stored temporarily somewhere, for efficiency reasons) the data you have writt-
	en, and if your program crashes for some reason, the data might not be written to 
	the file at all. The safe thing is to close your files after you¡¯re finished with 
	them.
	
	Close the file. A closed file cannot be read or written any more. Any operation -
	which requires that the file be open will raise a ValueError after the file has -
	been closed. Calling close() more than once is allowed.

def truncate([size]): # file.truncate
  '''
  Truncate the file¡¯s size. If the optional @size argument is present, the file is t-
  runcated to (at most) that size. The size defaults to the current position. The cu-
  rrent file position is not changed. Note that if a specified size exceeds the file¡¯s 
  current size, the result is platform-dependent: possibilities include that the file 
  may remain unchanged, increase to the specified size as if zero-filled, or increase 
  to the specified size with undefined new content.

Standard Files
  There are generally three standard files that are made available to you when your -
  program starts. These are standard input (usually the keyboard), standard output (-
  buffered output to the monitor or display), and standard error (unbuffered output -
  to the screen). (The ¡°buffered¡± or ¡°unbuffered¡± output refers to that third argume-
  nt to open()). These files are named stdin, stdout, and stderr and take their names 
  from the C language. When we say these files are ¡°available to you when your progr-
  am starts,¡± that means that these files are pre-opened for you, and access to these 
  files may commence once you have their file handles.
  Python makes these file handles available to you from the sys module. Once you imp-
  ort sys, you have access to these files as sys.stdin, sys.stdout, and sys.stderr. -
  The print statement normally outputs to sys.stdout while the raw_input() built-in -
  function receives its input from sys.stdin.


--> File Objects
 File objects are implemented using C¡¯s stdio package and can be created with the   -
 built-in open() function. File objects are also returned by some other built-in fun-
 ctions and methods, such as os.popen() and os.fdopen() and the makefile() method  of 
 socket objects. Temporary files can be created using the @tempfile module, and     -
 high-level file operations such as copying, moving, and deleting files and director-
 ies can be achieved with the @shutil module.
 
 When a file operation fails for an I/O-related reason, the exception @IOError is ra-
 ised. This includes situations where the operation is not defined for some reason, -
 like seek() on a tty device or writing a file opened for reading.
