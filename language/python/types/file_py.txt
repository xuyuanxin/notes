File objects are implemented using C¡¯s stdio package and can be created with the    -
built-in open() function.


file.readlines([sizehint])
    Read until EOF using readline() and return a list containing the lines thus read. 
	If the optional @sizehint argument is present, instead of reading up to EOF, who-
	le lines totalling approximately @sizehint bytes (possibly after rounding up to -
	an internal buffer size) are read. Objects implementing a file-like interface may 
	choose to ignore @sizehint if it cannot be implemented, or cannot be  implemented 
	efficiently.
