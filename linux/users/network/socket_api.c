 AF_xxx Versus PF_xxx
    The "AF_" prefix stands for "address family" and the "PF_" prefix stands for 
    "protocol family." Historically, the intent was that a single protocol family 
    might support multiple address families and that the PF_ value was used to 
    create the socket and the AF_ value was used in socket address structures. 
    But in actuality, a protocol family supporting multiple address families has 
    never been supported and the <sys/socket.h> header defines the PF_ value for 
    a given protocol to be equal to the AF_ value for that protocol. While there 
    is no guarantee that this equality between the two will always be true, should 
    anyone change this for existing protocols, lots of existing code would break. 
    To conform to existing coding practice, we use only the AF_ constants in this 
    text, although you may encounter the PF_ value, mainly in calls to socket.

 returns:
   0 if OK, -1 on error

 1 The client does not have to call @bind before calling connect: the kernel 
   will choose both an ephemeral port and the source IP address if necessary.
 2 In the case of a TCP socket, the @connect function initiates TCP's three-way 
   handshake.The function returns only when the connection is established or an 
   error occurs
 3 each time connect fails, we must close the socket descriptor and call socket 
   again.
 4 客户端connect发起三次握手,收到ack后返回(第二次握手),而服务器要第三个握手才返回
 5 When @connect is interrupted by a caught signal and is not automatically 
   restarted.If this function returns EINTR, we cannot call it again, as doing 
   so will return an immediate error.

There are several different error returns possible.
1 If the client TCP receives no response to its SYN segment, ETIMEDOUT is returned. 
  4.4BSD, for example, sends one SYN when connect is called, another 6 seconds 
  later, and another 24 seconds later. If no response is received after a total 
  of 75 seconds, the error is returned.Some systems provide administrative control 
  over this timeout;
2 If the server's response to the client's SYN is a reset (RST), this indicates 
  that no process is waiting for connections on the server host at the port 
  specified (i.e., the server process is probably not running). This is a hard 
  error and the error ECONNREFUSED is returned to the client as soon as the RST 
  is received.An RST is a type of TCP segment that is sent by TCP when something 
  is wrong. Three conditions that generate an RST are: when a SYN arrives for a 
  port that has no listening server (what we just described), when TCP wants to 
  abort an existing connection, and when TCP receives a segment for a connection 
  that does not exist. (TCPv1 [pp. 246C250] contains additional information.)
3 If the client's SYN elicits an ICMP "destination unreachable" from some 
  intermediate router, this is considered a soft error. The client kernel saves 
  the message but keeps sending SYNs with the same time between each SYN as in 
  the first scenario. If no response is received after some fixed amount of time 
  (75 seconds for 4.4BSD), the saved ICMP error is returned to the process as 
  either EHOSTUNREACH or ENETUNREACH. It is also possible that the remote system 
  is not reachable by any route in the local system's forwarding table, or that 
  the connect call returns without waiting at all.

 function:The @bind function assigns a local protocol address to a socket.
 returns: 0 if OK,-1 on error

1 With TCP, calling @bind lets us specify a port number, an IP address, both, or neither.
  A process can bind a specific IP address to its socket. The IP address must belong to an interface on the host.
2 If a TCP client or server does not do this, the kernel chooses an ephemeral port for the socket when either @connect or @listen is called. 
  It is normal for a TCP client to let the kernel choose an ephemeral port, unless the application requires a reserved port , but it is rare 
  for a TCP server to let the kernel choose an ephemeral port, since servers are known by their well-known port.
3 For a TCP client, this assigns the source IP address that will be used for IP datagrams sent on the socket. 
  For a TCP server, this restricts the socket to receive incoming client connections destined only to that IP address.
4 Normally, a TCP client does not bind an IP address to its socket. The kernel chooses the source IP address when the socket is connected,
  based on the outgoing interface that is used, which in turn is based on the route required to reach the server .
  If a TCP server does not bind an IP address to its socket, the kernel uses the destination IP address of the client's SYN as the server's source IP address .
5 If we specify a port number of 0, the kernel chooses an ephemeral port when bind is called. But if we specify a wildcard IP address, 
  the kernel does not choose the local IP address until either the socket is connected (TCP) or a datagram is sent on the socket (UDP).
6 With IPv4, the wildcard address is specified by the constant INADDR_ANY, whose value is normally 0. 
  The system allocates and initializes the in6addr_any variable to the constant IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT.

@sockfd:
@backlog:maximum number of connections the kernel should queue for this socket
function:TCP服务器调用
Returns: 0 if OK, -1 on error

When a socket is created by the socket function, it is assumed to be an active socket, that is, a client socket that will issue 
a connect. The listen function converts an unconnected socket into a passive socket, indicating that the kernel should accept 
incoming connection requests directed to this socket. In terms of the TCP state transition diagram , the call to listen moves 
the socket from the CLOSED state to the LISTEN state.

for a given listening socket, the kernel maintains two queues:
a) An incomplete connection queue, which contains an entry for each SYN that has arrived from a client for which the server is 
   awaiting completion of the TCP three-way handshake. These sockets are in the SYN_RCVD state .
b) A completed connection queue, which contains an entry for each client with whom the TCP three-way handshake has completed. 
   These sockets are in the ESTABLISHED state .
   当服务器收到SYN后，在未完成队列建立条目，并方发送SYN+ACK，当收到ACK后，该条目转移到完成队列，accept能够返回。

 1 If accept is successful, its return value is a brand-new descriptor automatically 
   created by the kernel.This new descriptor refers to the TCP connection with 
   the client.
 2 When discussing @accept, we call the first argument to @accept the listening 
   socket (the descriptor created by socket and then used as the first argument 
   to both @bind and @listen), and we call the return value from accept the

 3 A given server normally creates only one listening socket, which then exists 
   for the lifetime of the server.The kernel creates one connected socket for 
   each client connection that is accepted (i.e., for which the TCP three-way
