--> 排除多个
 排除掉aaaa和排除bbbb，使用如下代码：
 grep -v 'aaaa\|bbbb'  file



# It will return lines of text that contain the given match_pattern.
$ grep match_pattern filename
#Or:
$ grep "match_pattern" filename  

# We can also read from stdin as follows:
$ echo -e "this is a word\nnext line" | grep word

# Perform a search in multiple files using a single grep invocation as follows:
$ grep "match_text" file1 file2 file3 ...

# Usually, the grep command considers match_text as a wildcard. To use regular expre-
# ssions as input arguments, the -E option should be added, which means extended reg-
# ular expression. Or we can a use regular expression enabled grep command, egrep. F-
# or example:
$ grep -E "[a-z]+"
# Or:
$ egrep "[a-z]+"

# In order to output only the matching portion of text in a file, use the Co option -
# as follows:
$ echo this is a line. | grep -o -E "[a-z]+\."
line.
# Or:
$ echo this is a line. | egrep -o "[a-z]+\."
line.

# In order to print all of the lines, except the line containing match_pattern, use:
$ grep -v match_pattern file
# The Cv option added to grep inverts the match results.

# It should be noted that -c counts only the number of matching lines, not the numbe-
# r of times a match is made. For example:
$ echo -e "1 2 3 4\nhello\n5 6" | egrep -c "[0-9]"
2
# Even though there are 6 matching items, it prints 2 since there are only 2 matchin-
# g lines. Multiple matches in a single line are counted only once. In order to count 
# the number of matching items in a file, use the following hack:
$ echo -e "1 2 3 4\nhello\n5 6" | egrep -o "[0-9]" | wc -l
6
